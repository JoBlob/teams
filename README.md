I started out by laying down my game plan, i looked at the api returns and drew a first draft.
Since a filter is not something i am familiar with i cloned an official example from github as a basis

the app was created with create-react-app but i deleted the source folder to replace it with my own.

I wanted to make something more reusable for the actions but i ended up going with the simple/safe option instead as too not lose too much time
with a production app, i would've gotten assistance from someone more experienced than me on that issue
