npm start

npm run test

I wanted to keep things simple but I also wanted to use this project opportunity to learn a few things too so I started from scratch. I chose to go full redux since I'm used to be using it and it feels familiar to me. 

Displaying both lists was simple enough but the filter part did give me a little trouble.

I also had a few issues with routes where the url would change but the page would not re-render. I looked for some examples and documentation and I re-arranged a few things in order to solve the problem.

Another part that gave me trouble was testing. While I use to test components on my last project it had become so bloated that we had to cut tests almost entirely, leaving me rusty but that's not much of a problem, I managed to find some good documentation online.

Since I was already over the expected time limit I did not write tests for everything but I hope that those I did write will 
show you what I can do.

I would've liked to find a more reusable way to call the APIs but again, I wanted to keep things simple. If it had been a production app I would've asked for advice on how to write a more elegant/reusable piece of code.
